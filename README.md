# CustomFAISS

This repo intend to reproduce some of the famous FAISS algorithms in a simple Python fashion. We additionally build two databases and perform a performance comparison between the algorithms, and between this implementation and the original FAISS.

Results are available in the experiments_results.pdf file.
